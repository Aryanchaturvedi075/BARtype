# Deployment Configuration and Container Orchestration Guide

This guide outlines the deployment configuration for the BARtype application, including Docker containerization, multi-stage builds, and deployment strategies for different environments.

## Docker Configuration

### Backend Dockerfile

Create a multi-stage build configuration in `backend/Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
EXPOSE 3001 3002
CMD ["node", "dist/index.js"]

# Development stage
FROM node:18-alpine as development
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3001 3002
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

### Frontend Dockerfile

Create a multi-stage build configuration in `frontend/Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
# Build stage
FROM node:18-alpine as builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Production stage
FROM node:18-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/build ./build
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["node", "build/index.js"]

# Development stage
FROM node:18-alpine as development
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "run", "dev"]
```

### Docker Compose Configuration

Create three Docker Compose configurations for different environments:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml (Development)
version: '3.8'

services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      target: development
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
      - "3002:3002"
    volumes:
      - ./backend:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development

  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      target: development
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    volumes:
      - ./frontend:/app
      - /app/node_modules
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=development
    depends_on:
      - backend

# docker-compose.prod.yml (Production)
version: '3.8'

services:
  backend:
    build:
      context: ./backend
      target: production
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
      - "3002:3002"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3001/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3

  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./frontend
      target: production
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
    restart: unless-stopped
    depends_on:
      backend:
        condition: service_healthy
```

## Deployment Configuration for Azure

Create an Azure Container App deployment configuration:

```yaml
# .azure/deployment.yml
parameters:
  - name: environment
    type: string
    default: "development"

jobs:
  - job: Deploy
    steps:
      - task: DockerCompose@0
        inputs:
          containerregistrytype: "Azure Container Registry"
          azureSubscription: $(AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION)
          azureContainerRegistry: $(ACR_NAME)
          dockerComposeFile: "docker-compose.$(environment).yml"
          action: "Build services"
          projectName: $(Build.Repository.Name)
          qualifyImageNames: true
          additionalImageTags: |
            $(Build.BuildId)
            latest

      - task: AzureContainerApps@1
        inputs:
          azureSubscription: $(AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION)
          resourceGroup: $(RESOURCE_GROUP)
          containerAppName: "bartype-$(environment)"
          containerAppEnvironment: $(CONTAINER_ENV)
          targetPort: 3000
          ingress: "external"
          containerImage: $(ACR_NAME).azurecr.io/bartype-frontend:$(Build.BuildId)
          envVars: |
            NODE_ENV=$(environment)
```

## Deployment Scripts

Create deployment utility scripts in the root directory:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/deploy.sh

# Load environment variables
set -a
source .env.${ENVIRONMENT:-production}
set +a

# Build and deploy services
if [ "$ENVIRONMENT" = "production" ]; then
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
else
    docker-compose up -d --build
fi

# Health check
./scripts/health-check.sh

# Monitor logs
docker-compose logs -f
```

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/health-check.sh

MAX_RETRIES=10
RETRY_INTERVAL=5

check_health() {
    local service=$1
    local port=$2
    local retries=0

    while [ $retries -lt $MAX_RETRIES ]; do
        if curl -s http://localhost:$port/health > /dev/null; then
            echo "$service is healthy"
            return 0
        fi

        retries=$((retries + 1))
        sleep $RETRY_INTERVAL
    done

    echo "$service failed health check"
    return 1
}

check_health "backend" 3001
check_health "frontend" 3000
```

## Continuous Deployment Pipeline

Update the Azure Pipeline configuration to include deployment stages:

```yaml
# .azure/azure-pipelines.yml
stages:
  - stage: Build
    jobs:
      - job: BuildContainers
        steps:
          - task: DockerCompose@0
            inputs:
              dockerComposeFile: docker-compose.prod.yml
              action: Build services

  - stage: Test
    dependsOn: Build
    jobs:
      - job: RunTests
        # Previous test configuration remains the same

  - stage: Deploy
    dependsOn: Test
    condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main'))
    jobs:
      - deployment: Production
        environment: production
        strategy:
          runOnce:
            deploy:
              steps:
                - template: deployment.yml
                  parameters:
                    environment: production
```

This deployment configuration provides:

1. Multi-stage Docker builds optimized for different environments
2. Comprehensive health checking and monitoring
3. Environment-specific configurations
4. Automated deployment pipelines
5. Container orchestration with Docker Compose

The configuration supports both local development and production deployments while maintaining consistency across environments. The deployment process includes proper health checks and monitoring capabilities to ensure reliable application deployment.
