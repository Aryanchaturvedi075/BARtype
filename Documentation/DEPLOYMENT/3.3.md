# Continuous Integration Configuration Guide

This guide details the implementation of continuous integration pipelines for both GitHub Actions and Azure Pipelines, ensuring reliable testing and deployment of the BARtype application.

## GitHub Actions Configuration

Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` with the following configuration:

```yaml
name: BARtype CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [18.x]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
          cache: "npm"

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
          npm ci
          cd backend && npm ci
          cd ../frontend && npm ci
          npx playwright install --with-deps chromium

      - name: Backend Unit Tests
        run: npm run test:unit --workspace=backend

      - name: Frontend Component Tests
        run: npm run test:components

      - name: Integration Tests
        run: |
          npm run test:integration
          npm run test:e2e

      - name: Upload Test Results
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: test-results
          path: test-results/
          retention-days: 30

      - name: Report Test Results
        if: always()
        uses: dorny/test-reporter@v1
        with:
          name: Playwright Tests
          path: "test-results/*.xml"
          reporter: jest-junit
```

## Azure Pipelines Configuration

Create `.azure/azure-pipelines.yml` with the following configuration:

```yaml
trigger:
  - main

pool:
  vmImage: "ubuntu-latest"

variables:
  npm_config_cache: $(Pipeline.Workspace)/.npm

stages:
  - stage: Build
    jobs:
      - job: BuildContainers
        steps:
          - task: DockerCompose@0
            inputs:
              dockerComposeFile: docker-compose.prod.yml
              action: Build services

  - stage: Test
    dependsOn: Build
    jobs:
      - job: RunTests
        steps:
          - task: NodeTool@0
            inputs:
              versionSpec: "23.x"
            displayName: "Install Node.js"

          - task: Cache@2
            inputs:
              key: 'npm | "$(Agent.OS)" | package-lock.json'
              path: $(npm_config_cache)
            displayName: "Cache npm packages"

          - script: |
              npm ci
              cd backend && npm ci
              cd ../frontend && npm ci
              npx playwright install --with-deps chromium
            displayName: "Install dependencies"

          - script: |
              npm run test:unit --workspace=backend
            displayName: "Run backend tests"

          - script: |
              npm run test:components
            displayName: "Run frontend component tests"

          - script: |
              npm run test:integration
              npm run test:e2e
            displayName: "Run integration and E2E tests"

          - task: PublishTestResults@2
            inputs:
              testResultsFormat: "JUnit"
              testResultsFiles: "test-results/*.xml"
              mergeTestResults: true
              testRunTitle: "BARtype Test Results"
            displayName: "Publish test results"
            condition: always()

          - task: PublishPipelineArtifact@1
            inputs:
              targetPath: "test-results"
              artifact: "test-results"
              publishLocation: "pipeline"
            displayName: "Publish test artifacts"
            condition: always()

  stage: Deploy
    dependsOn: Test
    condition: and(succeeded(), eq(variables['Build.SourceBranch'], 'refs/heads/main'))
    jobs:
      - deployment: Production
        environment: production
        strategy:
          runOnce:
            deploy:
              steps:
                - template: deployment.yml
                  parameters:
                    environment: production
```

## Environment Configuration

For both CI environments, create environment-specific configuration files in the root directory:

```javascript
// .env.ci
NODE_ENV = test;
BACKEND_PORT = 3001;
FRONTEND_PORT = 3000;
WS_PORT = 3002;
```

## Package.json Updates

Update the root package.json to include CI-specific scripts:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "test:ci": "npm run test:unit --workspace=backend && npm run test:components && npm run test:integration && npm run test:e2e",
    "pretest:ci": "npm run build"
  }
}
```

The CI configuration ensures:

1. Consistent test execution across different environments
2. Proper dependency caching for faster builds
3. Comprehensive test reporting
4. Artifact preservation
5. Parallel test execution where appropriate

Both configurations follow similar patterns but leverage platform-specific features:

- GitHub Actions uses matrix testing for multiple Node.js versions
- Azure Pipelines provides detailed stage and job organization
- Both platforms implement caching and artifact preservation
- Test results are collected and published in a consistent format

This implementation provides a robust foundation for continuous integration, ensuring code quality and reliability throughout the development process.

Would you like me to detail the deployment configuration next, including container builds and deployment strategies?
