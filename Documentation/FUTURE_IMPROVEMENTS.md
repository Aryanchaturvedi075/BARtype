# Architectural Analysis: Frontend vs Backend Distribution

## Current Architecture

### Frontend Structure
```
frontend/
└── src/
    ├── core/           # Core infrastructure 
    │   ├── di/         # Dependency injection
    │   ├── errors/     # Error handling
    │   ├── events/     # Event management
    │   ├── state/      # State management
    │   └── time/       # Time utilities
    ├── lib/
    │   ├── components/ # UI components
    │   ├── services/   # Business logic
    │   └── stores/     # State stores
    └── routes/         # Page routes
```

### Backend Structure
```
backend/
└── src/
    ├── config/        # Configuration
    ├── services/      # Core services
    ├── middleware/    # Request handling
    ├── routes/        # API endpoints
    └── utils/         # Utilities
```

## Analysis of Current Distribution

### Frontend Responsibilities
1. Time-sensitive calculations
2. Text analysis and diffing
3. Performance metrics calculation
4. State management
5. Error handling
6. Event management
7. UI rendering
8. User interaction handling

### Backend Responsibilities
1. Text generation
2. Basic validation
3. API endpoint management
4. Session management
5. Error handling

## Proposed Redistribution

### Frontend Structure (Optimized)
```
frontend/
└── src/
    ├── components/    # Pure UI components
    ├── stores/        # UI state only
    ├── adapters/      # API communication
    └── routes/        # Page routes
```

### Backend Structure (Enhanced)
```
backend/
└── src/
    ├── config/       # Configuration
    ├── core/
    │   ├── typing/   # Text processing
    │   ├── metrics/  # Performance calculation
    │   └── events/   # Event handling
    ├── services/     # Business services
    ├── middleware/   # Request handling
    ├── routes/       # API endpoints
    └── utils/        # Utilities
```

## Comparative Analysis

### Current Approach Advantages
1. Better offline functionality
2. Reduced network latency
3. Immediate feedback
4. Reduced server load
5. Simpler deployment

### Current Approach Disadvantages
1. Business logic duplication
2. Increased frontend complexity
3. Harder to maintain consistency
4. Security concerns with client-side calculations
5. Larger client-side bundle

### Proposed Redistribution Advantages
1. Better separation of concerns
2. Centralized business logic
3. Easier maintenance
4. Better security
5. Lighter frontend bundle

### Proposed Redistribution Disadvantages
1. Increased network dependency
2. Higher latency
3. More complex API design
4. Increased server load
5. More complex deployment

## SOLID Principles Evaluation

### Current Architecture
1. Single Responsibility: Partially violated (frontend handles too many responsibilities)
2. Open/Closed: Well maintained
3. Liskov Substitution: Well maintained
4. Interface Segregation: Well maintained
5. Dependency Inversion: Well implemented

### Proposed Architecture
1. Single Responsibility: Better adherence
2. Open/Closed: Maintained
3. Liskov Substitution: Maintained
4. Interface Segregation: Improved
5. Dependency Inversion: Enhanced

## Recommendation

While the current architecture works, moving certain responsibilities to the backend would better align with architectural principles. Specifically:

1. Move text analysis to backend
2. Centralize performance calculations
3. Keep minimal state management in frontend
4. Maintain UI-specific logic in frontend

This would require:
1. Enhanced API design
2. WebSocket implementation for real-time feedback
3. Robust error handling
4. Careful consideration of network latency
